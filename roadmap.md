# Overview

We will be working on the following

I am trying to build an application that records a video from a meeting (like teams/zoom), converts it into text and then provides insights on the interview performance and possible areas for improvement.
- There should be a chrome plugin that pops up every time an online meeting starts
- The video recordings must be stored for later review
- The textual transcripts for the video must be stored
- The user must have a website to login and access their information
- There should be a payment gateway to allow VIP users access to AI insights on interview performance.
